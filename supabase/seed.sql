 I was born and raised on a picturesque farm in Southern Illinois, where my passion for farming and love for animals blossomed. Our farm was a bustling haven, teeming with pigs, horses, chickens, goats, and thriving crops like corn, soybeans, and alfalfa. It was an idyllic childhood, surrounded by nature''s beauty and the constant rhythm of farm life.
